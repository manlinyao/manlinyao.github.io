               <p>Crosstalk is a system that enables autonomous vehicles to communicate to pedestrians at crosswalks. I worked on an interdisiplinary team of engineering, cognitive science, architecture, and sociology students to conduct user research, uncover critical insights, ideate designs, test and iterate prototypes, and ultimately present our proof-of-concept design to executives and designers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in Detroit, Michigan.</p>

               <p>We are part of Design for America at Rice University, an organization with chapters in 36 universities that gives students the opportunity to tackle social challenges using the human-centered design process. We were partnered with Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles, who tasked teams to design solutions to help increase safety during the introduction of autonomous vehicles.</p>

            <p>Our final design is a long, narrow screen that wraps around the top of the windshield and front windows of an AV. When the car stops at crosswalk and senses a pedestrian there waiting to cross, the screen will illuminate with white walking symbols. The pedestrian then understands that the car has seen them and will feel safe in crossing the street. Pictured is the medium-fidelity, proof of concept prototype constructed from laser cut wood. The rendering shows the intended final design that preserves the car's aesthetic and aerodynamic qualities and integrates into the body.</p>

                  <h6 class="sub-step">Observations</h6>
                  <p>To get a better sense of our project scope and location of focus, we began our research through firsthand observations at the intersections around Rice University. We walked to two of the more problematic intersections in terms of walkability, safety, and infrastructural design and acted as pedestrians.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="process sub-step">
                  <h6 class="sub-step">Identifying Research Insights</h6>
                  <p>Through user research and observation, we found that pedestrians struggle to feel safe crossing the street in residential neighborhoods that do not have pedestrian crosslights.</p>
                  <p>Currently, with non-AV's, pedestrians currently play a "game of chicken" at unlighted crosswalks, relying on eye contact and hand waves to communicate with drivers. The pedestrian's feeling of safety hinges on the driver acknowledging the presence of the pedestrian. With an AV, the vehicle, not the human driver, is in control. There is no method for the car to have that same interaction with a pedestrian. We ideated around these insights.</p>

               <h5 class="step">Prototyping and Testing</h5>
               <!--Explaining prototyping step by step-->
               <div class="process sub-step">
                  <h6 class="sub-step">First Iteration</h6>
                  <p>Our first testing prototype was essentially a long strip of cardboard placed at an angle on the top of the car. The cardboard displayed the various words and symbols as depicted below.</p>
                  <img src="images/crosstalk_test1.png" alt="crosstalk first prototype" class="project-img">
                  <p>During the test, we had a team member run alongside the car and change out the signs to indicate the predicted movement of car. The idea was to make the pedestrians interacting with these cars feel safer in the space. We then recorded observations of the users acting as pedestrians and had them complete a survey after each test.</p>
                  <img src="images/crosstalk_test2.png" alt="crosstalk first prototype" class="project-img">
                  <p>After testing our first prototype, we concluded that only one exposure of the sign was necessary for users to figure out what to expect when seeing it on the car. Therefore, people would be able to easily catch on to the meanings of new symbols or lights that are introduced into the driving realm. Although our driver avoided looking at our users, we noticed that people still relied heavily on eye contact with the driver and would look to her for guidance.</p>
                  <p>One of the biggest insights we gathered from this test was that it was often difficult to understand whether the symbol or words was depicting intended motion of the pedestrians or the motion of the vehicles. Symbols seemed to have less ambiguity in their meanings because they are more or less universal (seen in crosswalk signals) and can overcome the language barrier. In terms of improvement, the sign needs to be placed more strategically on the car so that pedestrians and bikers from different angles can see the sign and should include lights to increase visibility.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="process sub-step">
                  <h6 class="sub-step">Second Iteration</h6>
                  <p>Our next prototype included lights and focused on using symbols to indicate pedestrian movement. We used the walking pedestrian, the stopping hand symbols, and a solid red bar.  We also tested with different colors (red, orange, white, green).</p>
                  <img src="images/crosstalk_test3.jpg" alt="crosstalk second prototype" class="project-img">
                  <img src="images/crosstalk_test4.jpg" alt="crosstalk second prototype" class="project-img">
                  <img src="images/crosstalk_test5.jpg" alt="crosstalk second prototype" class="project-img">
                  <p>After testing our second prototype, we noted that the excessive blinking of the lights often made the sign harder to read and suggested urgency. Additionally, we tested two color spectrums, red/green like traffic lights and orange/white like crosswalk signs. Users said that the orange/white light spectrum and symbols were easier to understand because those signs are generally seen at crosswalks and easily convey the action of the pedestrian.</p>
                  <p>Questions users brought up incuded:</p>
                  <ol class="bullet-pts">
                     <li>What about the transition between the car braking to when the car starts driving again?</li>
                     <li>Would the hand symbol suddenly change as the car starts to drive? </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>These are questions that we would need to address in our design. In this test we also tested a light bar similar to that of <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/multimedia/album/technology/av-light-bar.html">Ford’s</a>, and we noted that the meaning behind the different light colors and blinking speeds must be easily conveyed to pedestrians prior to use as users might perceive a multitude of ambiguous messages.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="project-step-content">
               <h5 class="step">Final Design</h5>
               <p>Based on testing results and further research on urban infrastructure and international light and symbol regulations, we improved Ford’s design, creating a product that would enable self-driving cars to clearly communicate whether it is safe for a pedestrian to cross the street.</p>

               <p>Our testing showed that displaying the walking person symbol in white most clearly conveyed the message, due to its ubiquity. Using words like "Go" or using green light were often misinterpreted as referring to the car's intended actions. In addition, compared to words, symbols communicate more quickly and without needing knowledge of English.</p>
               <img src="images/crosstalk_group.jpg" alt="Crosstalk group photo" class="project-img">
               <p>Our solution is a structure of three different boxes that wrap around the front side of the car that will be molded to the car to fit to the aesthetic of the model it is applied to. The symbols mimic that of existing crosswalk infrastructure, to let the pedestrian know when the car is recognizing them and that it is safe to cross.</p>

               <p>I loved participating in this project and applying cognitive sciences, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and sociology knowledge to design a future-centric physical product. With rapid technological development, designers and engineers must still consider relevant cultural, social, and environmental frameworks.</p>
